Welcome! I am Chia-Yu Hu (Mandarin: 胡家瑜),
an assistant professor at the Institute of Astrophysics at National Taiwan University.
As a computational astrophysicist, I study the dynamical and chemical processes in the interstellar medium
with hydrodynamical simulations and radiative transfer
to predict observables directly comparable with space- and ground-based telescopes.
My primary research interests include
**galaxy formation, interstellar chemistry, dust evolution, stellar feedback, galactic winds, turbulence, and numerical methods.**
