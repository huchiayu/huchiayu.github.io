### **Course Description**

- An introduction to fluid dynamics from a physicist’s perspective.


### **Instructor**

- Chia-Yu Hu (胡家瑜), assistant professor at [Institute of Astrophysics, National Taiwan University](https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/astro/engastro/Default.html)

- Office: R804, Astro-Math Building

- Email: <huchiayu@phys.ntu.edu.tw>


### **Course Objective**


- Understand the dynamics of fluids as continua

- Become familiar with basic tensor operations and index notation

- Get a glimpse of fluid dynamics in astrophysics

- Prepare yourself for more advanced topics such as plasma physics or stellar dynamics


### **Course Prerequisites**

- Basic knowledge of vector calculus and thermodynamics


### **Office Hour**

- TBD in class

- Modern Classical Physics: Optics, Fluids, Plasmas, Elasticity, Relativity, and Statistical Physics, by Kip S. Thorne and Roger D. Blandford

    - Highly pedagogical and insightful. Physically intuitive introduction to tensor algebra.

    - An earlier version is freely available [online](http://www.pmaweb.caltech.edu/Courses/ph136/yr2012/) (see Chaps. 13 - 19)

- The physics of astrophysics II: Gas dynamics, by Frank H. Shu

    - A rigorous treatment to fluid equations from microscopic kinetic theory. Numerous astrophysical applications.


- Fluid Mechanics, by L. D. Landau, E.M. Lifshitz

    - A classic. A bit too terse for newbies.



### **Grading**

- **Homework (5 assignments): 70%**

    - You are encouraged to discuss with your classmates! However, you must complete the homework independently.

    - Homework is due a week after distribution. Late homework receives a 10% penalty per day (so zero after 10 days)

- **Final Exam (closed book, cumulative): 30%**

    - 12/18, in class

- **Participation (extra credits): up to 3%**

    - Summarize what we’ve learned last week on stage (~ 5 mins) in the beginning of each class. Come sign up!
